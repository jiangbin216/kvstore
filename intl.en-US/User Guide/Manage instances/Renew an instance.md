# Renew an instance {#concept_fl3_rn4_tdb .concept}

## Background information {#section_s92_nes_1el .section}

-   You can renew a monthly/annually-purchased instance during the term of the contract or within 7 days after its expiration. Instances that have time-based payment are based on users' actual use, so instance renewal is unnecessary. For more information, see [Expiration/overdue strategy and renewal](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Expiration, overdue payment, and renewal.md#).
-   ApsaraDB for Redis allows both auto renewal and manual renewal.

## Procedure \(auto renew\) {#section_qp2_lll_vdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [Redis console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/kvstore).
2.  Select**Billing Management** \> **Renew,**and enter the Renew page.
3.  On the left-side navigation pane, select **ApsaraDB for Redis**.
4.  Click **Enable Auto-Renew** on the right of instance, set **Auto-Renew Cycle**, and auto renew is activated.

## Procedure \(manually renew\) {#section_p2y_lll_vdb .section}

**Note:** You can reset instance configuration when doing manual renewal. With no renewal, if you still need to change configurations, see [Change configuration](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Manage instances/Change configuration.md#).

1.  Log on to the [Redis console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/kvstore), find the expected subscribed instance, and click **Renew**.
2.  Enter Confirm Order page, select the expected renewal period, and click **OK**.

    **Note:** 

    To reset instance configuration, select **Change Configuration**, then set your target configuration. For information on configuration change and billing standard during renewal period, see [Upgrade and downgrade the configuration](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Upgrade and downgrade the configuration.md#).

3.  Enter a page for payment after submission, select your expected billing method, and click **Confirm Subscription**.

    Finally, you are redirected to a page confirming successful payment.
