# Modify retention period for classic network {#concept_k1m_jcg_vdb .concept}

After setting the retention period for the access address of a classic network, you can prolong the retention time on the console before the time expires.

In the hybrid access period, you can change the retention time of the original classic network at any time as needed. The expiration date is recalculated from the new date. For example, if the Intranet address of the original classic network is set to expire on August 18, 2017 and you change the expiration date to 14 days later on August 15, 2017, the Intranet address is released on August 29, 2017.
